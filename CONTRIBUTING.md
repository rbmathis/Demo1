## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control
- Your favorite code editor ([VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) recommended)
- A GitHub account

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Demo1.git
   cd Demo1
   ```

3. **Add the upstream remote**:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/rbmathis/Demo1.git
   ```

4. **Restore dependencies**:

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   libman restore
   ```

5. **Run the application**:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

6. **Run the tests**:
   ```bash
   cd tests/Demo1.UnitTests
   dotnet test
   ```

### Using VS Code

This project includes VS Code configurations for debugging:

- Press **F5** to build and run the application with the debugger attached
- Tasks are available for build, test, and watch operations

## 🔄 Development Workflow

1. **Create a branch** for your work:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

   Use prefixes like:

   - `feature/` for new features
   - `fix/` for bug fixes
   - `docs/` for documentation
   - `test/` for test improvements

2. **Make your changes** with clear, focused commits

3. **Write or update tests** for your changes

4. **Run tests locally** to ensure everything passes:

   ```bash
   dotnet test
   ```

5. **Commit your changes** with a descriptive message:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add awesome feature that does X"
   ```

   Or use our snarky commit script for fun:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/commit.sh
   ```

6. **Keep your branch updated** with upstream:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

7. **Push to your fork**:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

8. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub!

## 🎯 Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

- **Follow existing patterns** - Look at similar code for examples
- **Keep it simple** - Prefer clarity over cleverness
- **Write tests** - Test your code before submitting
- **Document public APIs** - Use XML comments for all public classes and methods
- **Be consistent** - Match the style of the existing codebase

### C# Conventions

- Use **PascalCase** for class names, method names, and properties
- Use **camelCase** for local variables and parameters
- Use **meaningful names** that describe intent
- Keep methods **focused** on a single responsibility
- Use **async/await** for asynchronous operations

### XML Documentation

All public APIs should have XML documentation:

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Brief description of what this does.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="paramName">Description of parameter.</param>
/// <returns>Description of return value.</returns>
public async Task<IActionResult> MethodName(string paramName)
{
    // Implementation
}
```

**Note**: Test files don't require XML documentation - focus on clear test names!

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

- Write **unit tests** for business logic
- Include **integration tests** for important workflows
- Use **descriptive test names** that explain what's being tested
- Follow the **Arrange-Act-Assert** pattern
- Keep tests **focused** on a single scenario

Example test name: `Should_ReturnViewResult_When_IndexCalled()`
