# `.github/agents/` — Custom Copilot Agents

This folder contains **custom agent definitions** for GitHub Copilot. Each file defines a specialized AI persona that can be selected in VS Code's Copilot Chat, in the GitHub Copilot cloud agent on GitHub.com, or invoked as a subagent by the orchestrator.

## AI-SDLC Pipeline

This repository implements a **fully-autonomous AI-driven SDLC pipeline** that runs both remotely (via GitHub Agentic Workflows) and locally (via Copilot CLI).

```
🏷️ Triage → 📋 Plan → 🔨 Implement → 👀 Review → 🚀 Land
```

**Local usage (Copilot CLI):** Say "run issue 135" — the `autopilot` agent auto-chains through all stages.

**Remote usage (GitHub Actions):** Apply the `pipeline/triage-requested` label to an issue — the `pipeline-triage.md` workflow kicks off the same flow on GitHub runners.

Each stage posts comments on the GitHub issue, providing full transparency of AI thinking and decisions.

## How Copilot Discovers and Activates These Agents

GitHub Copilot automatically scans the `.github/agents/` folder for any file ending in `.agent.md`. No registration or configuration is required — just drop a properly formatted file here and it appears in the agents dropdown in Copilot Chat.

**Activation paths:**

| Context | How to activate |
|---------|----------------|
| VS Code Copilot Chat | Select agent from the agents dropdown at the bottom of the Chat panel |
| GitHub.com cloud agent | Choose agent from the Copilot Chat interface on github.com (requires `target: github-copilot`) |
| Subagent invocation | The `orchestrator` agent calls other agents via the `agent` tool |

## Agent File Format

Each `.agent.md` file uses YAML frontmatter to declare its identity and capabilities, followed by Markdown instructions that define the agent's behavior:

```markdown
---
name: optional-display-name         # Defaults to filename without extension
description: "Required. Short description shown in the agents dropdown."
tools: ['read', 'edit', 'search']   # Tool access list (empty list disables ALL tools)
agents: ['*']                        # Optional: subagents this agent can invoke (* = all)
model: claude-sonnet-4-5 (copilot)  # Optional: pin to a specific model or array of models
target: vscode                       # Optional: 'vscode' or 'github-copilot' (default: both)
user-invocable: true                 # Optional: show in agents dropdown (default: true)
disable-model-invocation: false      # Optional: prevent subagent invocation (default: false)
argument-hint: "Describe your task"  # Optional: hint text shown in the chat input field

### Tool Sets and Tools Reference

> **Important:** `tools: []` disables **all** tools. Omit the `tools` property entirely to grant access to all available tools.
>
> You can reference entire tool sets (e.g., `search`) or individual tools (e.g., `search/usages`). Tool sets include MCP tools and extension tools in addition to built-in tools.

## Pipeline Labels

These labels track pipeline progress on GitHub issues:

| Label | Stage |
|-------|-------|
| `pipeline/triage-requested` | Trigger: starts the remote pipeline (via GitHub Actions) |
| `local/triage` | Being classified (local agents) |
| `local/planning` | Plan being created (local agents) |
| `local/implementing` | Code being written (local agents) |
| `local/review` | PR under review (local agents) |
| `local/done` | Pipeline complete, issue closed (local agents) |

## GitHub Actions Workflows

The remote pipeline uses GitHub Agentic Workflows (`.github/workflows/pipeline-*.md`):

| Workflow | Trigger |
|----------|---------|
| `pipeline-triage.md` | `pipeline/triage-requested` label applied |
| `pipeline-plan.md` | Dispatched by triage |
| `pipeline-implement.md` | Dispatched by plan |
| `pipeline-review.md` | PR opened / review requested |
| `pipeline-deploy.md` | PR closed (merged) |
| `pipeline:blocked` | Needs human | Red |
| `pipeline:failed` | Failed (exhausted retries) | Red |

### Retry Strategy

Each stage gets **2 automatic retry attempts**. On each retry, the pipeline:
1. Posts a narrative explaining the retry strategy
2. Increments the attempt counter in state
3. Re-triggers the failed stage with fresh context

After 2 failures: applies `pipeline:failed`, posts a comprehensive diagnosis, and requests human intervention.
