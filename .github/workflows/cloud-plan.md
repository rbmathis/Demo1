## Pipeline — Plan Agent

Run the imported `plan` agent instructions as the planning policy for the cloud AI-SDLC pipeline. Use the imported `feature-flags` specialist whenever the triage handoff requires rollout analysis.

**Target issue:** #${{ github.event.inputs.issue_number }}

## Cloud Duties

1. Remove existing `cloud/*` labels and add `cloud/planning`.
2. Read issue #${{ github.event.inputs.issue_number }}, including the `Pipeline — Triage` handoff comment.
3. Use the imported plan agent to research the codebase and create the implementation plan.
4. If triage says `rollout-required` or `rollout-optional`, apply the imported `feature-flags` specialist guidance and embed the canonical rollout checklist in the plan comment.
5. If triage says `rollout-exempt`, state that the issue is rollout-exempt and skip rollout analysis.
6. Post one plan comment headed `## 📋 Pipeline — Plan` with branch, implementation steps, agent delegation, acceptance criteria, testing requirements, and rollout consultation status.
7. Replace `cloud/planning` with `cloud/implementing`.
8. Dispatch `cloud-implement` with `issue_number` set to `${{ github.event.inputs.issue_number }}`.

## Cloud Overrides

- Cloud labels, branch naming, issue comment headings, and workflow dispatch rules in this file override local-only instructions in the imported plan agent.
- The plan must be specific enough for the asynchronous Copilot coding agent assigned by `cloud-implement` to execute without ambiguity.
- Documentation and tests must be represented in the plan even though docs run as a separate cloud stage after review.
- If the plan cannot be fully determined, post the best known plan and still dispatch `cloud-implement`.
