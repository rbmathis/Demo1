## Pipeline — Triage Agent

Run the imported `triage` agent instructions as the classification policy for the cloud AI-SDLC pipeline.

**Target issue:** #${{ github.event.inputs.issue_number }}

## Cloud Duties

1. Remove existing `cloud/*` labels and add `cloud/triage` before classification.
2. Read issue #${{ github.event.inputs.issue_number }} and classify it using the imported triage policy.
3. Include rollout status in the triage result: `rollout-required`, `rollout-optional`, or `rollout-exempt`.
4. Post one cloud triage handoff comment headed `## 🏷️ Pipeline — Triage`.
5. Apply 1-2 classification labels from the allowed type labels.
6. Replace `cloud/triage` with `cloud/planning`.
7. Dispatch `cloud-plan` with `issue_number` set to `${{ github.event.inputs.issue_number }}`.

## Cloud Overrides

- Cloud labels and dispatching rules in this workflow override any local label guidance in the imported agent.
- Every triggered issue is classified; do not reject or skip unless GitHub access fails.
- If dispatch fails, call `noop` with the reason.
- The triage comment must contain enough context for `cloud-plan` to identify classification, scope, agents needed, and rollout status.
