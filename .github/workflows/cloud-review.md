## Pipeline — Review Agent

Run the imported `review` agent instructions as the review policy for the cloud AI-SDLC pipeline. Use the imported `feature-flags` guidance when rollout compliance is applicable.

**Target issue:** #${{ github.event.inputs.issue_number }}

## Cloud Duties

1. Find the PR linked to issue #${{ github.event.inputs.issue_number }} using issue timeline cross-reference events first, then closing-keyword body/title search as fallback.
2. Remove existing `cloud/*` labels and add `cloud/review`.
3. Post one `## 🔄 Pipeline — Review In Progress` status comment with the PR number.
4. Review the PR using the imported review policy and specialist-review expectations.
5. When triage or plan includes `rollout-required` or `rollout-optional`, block approval for missing rollout checklist, missing flag-off/flag-on tests, unsafe side-effect behavior, missing cleanup reference for temporary flags, or missing observability.
6. Submit exactly one PR review with verdict `APPROVE`, `REQUEST_CHANGES`, or `COMMENT`.
7. Post one issue comment headed `## 🏗️ Pipeline — Implementation Report` with PR, branch, verdict, change summary, and review summary.
8. Dispatch the next stage according to the cloud dispatch chain below.

## Cloud Dispatch Chain

- `APPROVE` or `COMMENT`: replace `cloud/review` with `cloud/awaiting-merge`, then dispatch `cloud-docs` with `issue_number` set to `${{ github.event.inputs.issue_number }}`.
- `REQUEST_CHANGES`: keep `cloud/review`, count previous request-changes implementation reports, and dispatch `cloud-implement` only if fewer than 2 rework cycles have already occurred.
- If 2 rework cycles have already occurred, post a halt comment and do not dispatch another workflow.

## Cloud Overrides

- Cloud PR discovery, label transitions, review submission limits, and workflow dispatch rules in this file override local-only instructions in the imported review agent.
- Keep PR discovery aligned with `cloud-finish.yml`: timeline linkage first, keyword scans second.
- The implementation report is mandatory because it is the official issue-level pipeline record.
