      ## YOUR MISSION

      Implement the plan from issue #${{ github.event.inputs.issue_number }}.

      ## STEP 0: READ THE PLAN (do this first)

      Read issue #${{ github.event.inputs.issue_number }} and find the comment titled "📋 Pipeline — Plan". That comment has your implementation plan with specific files, changes, and acceptance criteria. Follow it precisely.

      ## STEP 1: IMPLEMENT

      Use the specialized sub-agents in .github/agents/:
      - `backend` agent for Controllers, Models, Services, Middleware, Program.cs
      - `frontend` agent for Views, Razor templates, CSS, JavaScript
      - `security` agent for security vulnerabilities (CSRF, XSS, SQL injection, auth)

      ## STEP 2: TEST (mandatory — do not skip)

      Use `testing` agent to generate unit tests and integration tests for ALL changes.

      ## STEP 3: DOCUMENT (mandatory — do not skip)

      Use `docs` agent to:
      - Add/update XML documentation on all new/modified public methods and classes
      - Update docs/ markdown files if the change affects architecture or APIs

      ## STEP 4: VALIDATE

      Use `build-validator` agent to verify the project builds cleanly and tests pass.

      ## CRITICAL: PR BODY REQUIREMENT

      When creating the pull request, the PR body MUST include a closing keyword line:

      `
      Closes #${{ github.event.inputs.issue_number }}
      `

      This line is required for the pipeline to automatically detect the linked issue and trigger the review stage. Do not omit it.

      NOTE: Do NOT post an implementation report on the issue. The review pipeline handles that automatically.

## Pipeline — Implement Agent

You are the implementation coordinator. You read the plan from the issue and assign Copilot coding agent to execute it.

**Target issue:** #${{ github.event.inputs.issue_number }}

## Your Task

1. **Read the issue** (#${{ github.event.inputs.issue_number }}) — title, body, and all comments
2. **Ensure `cloud/implementing` label is on the issue** (remove any other `cloud/*` labels)
3. **Find the plan comment** — look for the comment containing "Pipeline — Plan" with the implementation steps
4. **Post a status comment** confirming you're assigning the coding agent
5. **Assign Copilot coding agent** to issue #${{ github.event.inputs.issue_number }}

## Status Comment Format

Post this on issue #${{ github.event.inputs.issue_number }}:

```markdown
## 🚀 Pipeline — Implement

**Timestamp:** [UTC time]
**Status:** Copilot coding agent assigned

The plan has been reviewed and the coding agent has been assigned to execute the implementation.

### ⏸️ Pipeline paused — waiting for Copilot to finish

The coding agent works asynchronously. When it finishes, a PR will be created and you will receive a notification that the PR is ready for review.

**To resume the pipeline:** apply the `cloud/review` label to this issue. That will trigger the automated review stage, and the rest of the pipeline (review → docs → merge → close) will run automatically.
```

## Important

- Always assign the agent to the correct issue number: ${{ github.event.inputs.issue_number }}
- The custom-instructions already tell the coding agent to read the plan from the issue
- If the plan comment is missing, still assign the agent — it will figure it out from the issue body
- If you cannot assign the agent, call `noop` with an explanation
